# Bits and pieces of code to use with quitte-style data frames

R package **quitte**, version **0.3084.0**

  

## Purpose and Functionality

A collection of functions for easily dealing with
    quitte-style data frames, doing multi-model comparisons and plots.


## Installation

For installation of the most recent package version an additional repository has to be added in R:

```r
options(repos = c(CRAN = "@CRAN@", pik = "https://rse.pik-potsdam.de/r/packages"))
```
The additional repository can be made available permanently by adding the line above to a file called `.Rprofile` stored in the home folder of your system (`Sys.glob("~")` in R returns the home directory).

After that the most recent version of the package can be installed using `install.packages`:

```r 
install.packages("quitte")
```

Package updates can be installed using `update.packages` (make sure that the additional repository has been added before running that command):

```r 
update.packages()
```

## Tutorial

The package comes with a vignette describing the basic functionality of the package and how to use it. You can load it with the following command (the package needs to be installed):

```r
vignette("quitte-data-analysis") # REMIND/IAM Data Analysis Using quitte
```
